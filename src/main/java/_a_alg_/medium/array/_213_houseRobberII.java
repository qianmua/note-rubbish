 * @Description:
 *`      You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street.
 *`      Each house has a certain amount of money stashed.
 *`      All houses at this place are arranged in a circle.
 *`      That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one.
 *`      Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected
 *`      and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
 *`      Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house,
 *`      determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
 *
 *`   Example 1:
 *`      Input: [2,3,2]
 *`      Output: 3
 *`      Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
 *`      because they are adjacent houses.
 *
 *`   Example 2:
 *`      Input: [1,2,3,1]
 *`      Output: 4 Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
 *`      Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
