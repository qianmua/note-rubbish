 * @Description: 1
 * `          There are N gas stations along a circular route,
 * `          where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].
 * `          You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its
 * next station (i+1).
 * `          You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
 * `          Return the starting gas station's index
 * `          if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.
 * `
 * `          Note:
 * `              If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
 * `              Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
 * `              Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.
 * `
 * `          沿循环路线有N个加油站，
 * `          其中，第i个站点的天然气量为gas [i]。
 * `          您有一辆带无限油箱的汽车，从第i站到下一个（i + 1）的行车成本为[i]。
 * `          您可以从其中一个加油站的空罐开始旅程。
 * `          返回起始加油站的索引
 * `          如果您可以沿顺时针方向绕过电路一次，否则返回-1。
 * `          注意：
 * `              如果存在解决方案，则保证是唯一的。
 * `              两个输入数组都是非空的，并且具有相同的长度。
 * `              输入数组中的每个元素都是非负整数。
 * `      Example 1:
 * `          Input:
 * `              gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
 * `              cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
 * `          Output: 3
 * `          Explanation:
 * `              Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas.
 * `              Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4 Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8 Travel to station 0.
 * `              Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7 Travel to station 1.
 * `              Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6 Travel to station 2.
 * `              Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5 Travel to station 3.
 * `              The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
 * `              Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
 * `      Example 2:
 * `          Input:
 * `              gas  = [2,3,4]
 * `              cost = [3,4,3]
 * `          Output: -1
 * `          Explanation:
 * `              You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
 * `              Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas.
 * `              Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4 Travel to station 0.
 * `              Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3 Travel to station 1.
 * `              Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3 You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you
 * only have 3.
 * `              Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
